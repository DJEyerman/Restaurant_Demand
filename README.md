# Customer Experience Analytics for Online Food Ordering

## Objective:
    The primary objective of this data analytics project was to enhance the customer experience in 
    online food ordering by optimizing delivery operations. This involved conducting delivery analytics 
    to ensure efficient staff availability, monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), and perform 
    in-depth analyses on customer behavior and restaurant characteristics.

## Key Activities:

  ### Delivery Analytics for Operational Optimization:

    Conducted a comprehensive analysis of delivery operations to optimize staff availability based on 
    varying restaurant demand.
    Monitored operational KPIs, including customer retention, churn rate, order cost, and delivery time, 
    to identify areas for improvement.

  ### Dashboard Creation in Tableau:

    Developed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard in Tableau to present key metrics and 
    trends related to delivery operations and customer experience.
    Utilized Tableau's features to provide stakeholders with real-time insights and facilitate 
    data-driven decision-making.

  ### Visualization and Metrics Comparison in Python:

    Implemented data visualization techniques in Python to complement the Tableau dashboard.
    Visualized and compared key metrics using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and 
    Seaborn, providing a comprehensive perspective on performance.

  ### Multivariate Analysis for Revenue Segmentation:

    Conducted multivariate analysis to segment revenue based on various restaurant characteristics.
    Explored factors such as restaurant popularity, high-revenue orders, and other relevant 
    attributes to identify patterns and opportunities for revenue optimization.

## Results and Impact:

  ### Operational Efficiency Improvement:
      The delivery analytics led to improved operational efficiency by aligning staff 
      availability with fluctuating restaurant demand, reducing delivery times, and 
      optimizing order costs.
  
  ### Customer Experience Enhancement:
      Monitoring KPIs such as customer retention and churn rate facilitated a deeper understanding 
      of customer behavior, leading to targeted strategies for enhancing overall customer experience.
  
  ### Revenue Optimization through Segmentation:
      Multivariate analysis provided actionable insights into revenue segmentation based on restaurant 
      characteristics. This allowed for tailored approaches to popular restaurants and high-revenue 
      order patterns, contributing to revenue optimization.

## Technologies Used:

    Tableau for interactive dashboard creation.
    Python for data visualization using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
    Statistical techniques for multivariate analysis and segmentation.

## Conclusion:
    This data analytics project successfully contributed to the optimization of customer experience 
    in online food ordering by implementing strategic delivery analytics and revenue segmentation. 
    The combination of Tableau and Python allowed for a comprehensive exploration of key metrics, 
    enabling data-driven decision-making and continuous improvements in operational efficiency and 
    revenue generation.
